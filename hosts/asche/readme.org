#+title: Dell XPS 9300 (2020 Developer Edition)

* Before Install NixOS
I got a developer edition ship with Ubuntb. When I boot up the machine for first time, it asked me whether want to back up the system into ISO on an USB.

** Praticle Install NixOS on VirtualBox

** Read Dell Manual

** Check Arch Wiki page for XPS 9300 and update some BIOS setting
Pressing F2/F12 key to BIOS menu

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_XPS_13_(9300)

- Make sure SATA Mode from "RAID" to "AHCi" already the default on developer edition

- Disable secure boot to allow Linux to boot
  (which is not default, although archlinux page state it should be disabled by default )

- POST Behavior
  Sign of Life
  - Early Logo Display
  - Early keyboard backlight

* Install
I chose not to go with dual-boot, just wipe the disk install nixos
I use graphical install
https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-20.09/latest-nixos-gnome-x86_64-linux.iso

** TODO add how to burn iso
Press F12, and boot from usb

The first problem I got is, the build-in wifi cannot find by install. I think it is the same problem with
https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-minimal-install-doesnt-have-wifi-firmware/7318

Lucky for me, I had a usb wifi adapter which can regonzied with installer.

Without internet access, we cannot finish OS installment.

** How to wipe existing disk
~wipefs -a /dev/nvme0n1~



** Partition time
https://gist.github.com/little-dude/03b68e9e9908d940520fbeb420b49869
 mostly just followed

- primary disk is `dev/nvme0n1`

  sudo su
parted /dev/sda -- mklabel gpt


Information: you may need to update /etc/fstab can be safely ignored

*** How to find uuid of partition

blkid

ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid

https://linuxhint.com/uuid_storage_devices_linux/

*** Copy/paste in linux terminal
is Ctrl + Shift + C/V

I tried to reference home not by uuid. That didn't seem to work. Machine failed to boot, had to press the start button to shut down the machine.
** Encrypt primary disk

~cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p2~

Warning about overwrite
Confirm with YES
enter passpharse

# open the encrypted partition and map it to /dev/mapper/cryptroot
$ cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/nvme0n1p2 cryptroot

Map the physical, encrypted volume, then create a new volume group and logical volumes in that group for our nixos root and our swap.

~pvcreate /dev/mapper/cryptroot~

Physical volume "/dev/mapper/cryptroot" successfully created.

~vgcreate vg /dev/mapper/cryptroot~
tab completion on path works

Volume group "vg" successfully created.

~lvcreate -L 8G -n swap vg~
Logical volume "swap" created.

~lvcreate -l '100%FREE' -n nixos vg~
Logical volume "nixo" created.

** Format Disks
~mkfs.fat -F 32 -n boot /dev/nvme0n1p1~

mkfs.fat warning - lowercase label might not work properly with DOS or Windows

~mkfs.ext4 -L nixos /dev/vg/nixos~
it might take longer than steps

mkfs.ext4 -L nixos /dev/vg/nixos

** Mount
mount /dev/disk/by-label/nixos /mnt

lsblk --fs

* First round of nixos configuration
** Set user password
~passwd username~

I need to
~boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_latest;~
to find laptop's wifi
