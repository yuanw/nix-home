  Delegation mode for open-code-review (OCR). Instead of OCR calling an LLM

# Open Code Review — Delegation Mode

A skill for performing AI code review where OCR provides deterministic engineering (file filtering, rule resolution) and the host agent performs the actual review using its own intelligence and tools.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Preview — Determine What to Review

```bash
ocr delegate preview --format json [--from <ref> --to <ref>] [--commit <hash>] [--exclude <patterns>]
```

This outputs:
- **mode** (workspace / range / commit)
- **from / to / commit / merge_base** — ref metadata for constructing git commands
- **Reviewable file list** — paths, status, insertions/deletions
- **Excluded files** — with exclusion reason

**Common invocations:**

| Scenario | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Workspace changes | `ocr delegate preview` |
| Branch comparison | `ocr delegate preview --from main --to feature` |
| Single commit | `ocr delegate preview -c abc123` |

### Step 2: Get Rules for Files

```bash
ocr delegate rule --format json <path1> <path2> ...
```

Pass the reviewable file paths from Step 1. Output is grouped by rule content — files sharing the same rule appear under one group, avoiding repetition.

### Step 3: Get Diffs

Use git directly based on the mode/ref info from Step 1:

**Range mode** (merge_base provided in preview output):
```bash
git diff <merge_base>..<to> -- <path>
```

**Commit mode**:
```bash
git show <commit> -- <path>
```

**Workspace mode**:
```bash
# Tracked files
git diff HEAD -- <path>
# New untracked files — read directly (entire file is new code)
cat <path>
```

### Step 4: Review Each File

Create a checklist containing every `reviewable_files` entry. For each reviewable file:

Use `(path, status)` as the checklist identity. Workspace mode can report the same path twice when a staged deletion is followed by an untracked recreation.

1. Get its diff (Step 3)
2. Consult its Rule Group (from Step 2) for the review checklist
3. Conduct a thorough review, using appropriate context tools as needed
4. Mark the file `reviewed`, or `skipped` with a concrete reason

For large changes, review in bounded batches grouped by shared rules and diff size. Do not stop after finding the first high-severity issue.

### Step 5: Format Output

Each comment must follow this structure:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| path | string | yes | Relative file path |
| content | string | yes | Review comment describing the issue |
| start_line | integer | no | Start line in the new file |
| end_line | integer | no | End line in the new file |
| category | enum | no | bug, security, performance, maintainability, test, style, documentation, other |
| severity | enum | no | critical, high, medium, low |

### Step 6: Classify and Report

Before reporting, verify that every previewed file is accounted for. Include `total_files`, `reviewed_files`, `skipped_files`, and `coverage_rate` in the summary. A skipped file must include its reason.

Group findings by severity:

- **Critical/High**: Bugs, security issues, data loss risks — always report
- **Medium**: Performance concerns, error handling gaps, maintainability issues — report with context
- **Low**: Style nits, minor suggestions — report only if clearly valuable

Discard likely false positives silently.

### Step 7: Fix (Optional)

If the user requested "review and fix":
- Apply High/Critical fixes directly
- Describe Medium fixes that require manual intervention
- Skip Low-priority items unless trivial

## Sub-commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ocr delegate preview` | Which files to review + mode/ref metadata |
| `ocr delegate rule <path...>` | Review rules grouped by content |

## Shared Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--from <ref>` | Source ref for range mode |
| `--to <ref>` | Target ref for range mode |
| `-c, --commit <hash>` | Single commit mode |
| `--repo <path>` | Repository root (default: cwd) |
| `--rule <path>` | Custom rule.json path |
| `--exclude <patterns>` | Comma-separated exclude patterns |
| `-b, --background <text>` | Business context |
| `-B, --background-file <path>` | Business context from Markdown file (takes precedence over `-b`) |
| `-f, --format <text\|json>` | Output format; use `json` for agent integrations |

## Gotchas

- **No LLM needed on OCR side** — delegation mode never calls an LLM. All intelligence comes from the host agent.
- **Rules are grouped** — Files sharing the same rule are grouped together in the output. You can pass any number of paths per call; for large changes, fetch rules per-batch as you review.
- **Working directory matters** — `ocr delegate` operates on the Git repo at the current directory. Use `--repo /path` to override.
- **Untracked files in workspace mode** — `preview` includes untracked files. For these, read the file directly instead of using `git diff`.
- **Background context** — pass `--background` to `preview` when you have requirement context; it appears in the output for your reference during review.
- **Coverage is mandatory** — every `reviewable_files` entry must end as reviewed or explicitly skipped; do not silently omit files.

### Troubleshooting CLI Version Compatibility

The `--format` flag is available in `ocr` v1.9.0 and later. If a requested `preview` or `rule` command with `--format json` fails specifically with `unknown flag: --format`, rerun it without the flag and use text output for the rest of the delegation run.
